The goal is not just to be smaller, but to be clearer. However, sometimes
idiomatic code in a language is not the clearest code to someone who isn't
familiar with it. It's also nice, sometimes, to see what different 
approaches look like. To that end, there may be more than one implementation
of each task.

Red is available at http://red-lang.org

If you install Red (single EXE, just drop in a folder), you can run all task
demos from the launcher. The following will run the launcher from the repo.
